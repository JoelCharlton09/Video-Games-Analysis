# Video-Games-Analysis
This was one of the first data projects I completed at university. The goal of this project was to complete an analysis on any dataset and demonstrate our ability to code in Python as well as to show that we are able to perform an analysis using the language. The data used for the analysis can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales) and relates to video games sales data. The data is based on figures from [VGChartz](https://www.vgchartz.com/), which is a website that keeps track of weekly video games sales. The dataset contains 16,598 records and 11 variables, the dataset was last updated in 2016 which will be taken into consideration during the data preprocessing. The source of the data states that two of the records were dropped due to incomplete information. A name and description for wach variable can be seen below:

* Rank - The ranking position of overall sales
* Name - The name of the game
* Platform - The console which the game was released on, there are 31 categories for this
* Year - Year that the game was released
* Genre - Genre of the game (e.g. Sports, Shooter etc)
* Publisher - Company that published the game
* NA_Sales - The number of sales (in millions) in North America
* EU_Sales - The number of sales (in millions) in Europe
* JP_Sales - The number of sales (in millions) in Japan
* Other_Sales - The number of sales (in millions) in the rest of the world
* Global_Sales - The number of sales (in millions) worldwide
